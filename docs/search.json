This session will introduce advocates to the technical tools needed to become a trusted authority for modeling potential changes to their state’s school funding formula. Participants will get a crash course in building data analysis and modeling skills, hear from other advocates who’ve put these skills to use to shape policy, and get to know colleagues across the Network who can support future funding reform efforts."

It also covers key policy knowledge needed to advocate for equitable and effective state education finance systems.\nParticipants will:\n\nLearn best practices for importing and cleaning data and processing it into datasets.\nVisualize analysis of education finance data and export the results as static or interactive tables, plots, and maps.\n\nFor participants with limited background in school finance policy, please read Bellwether’s Splitting the Bill prior to the training session."

During this training, we will use the following packages:\n\ntidyverse: This package is actually a collection of packages that provide essential tools for data cleaning (dplyr) and visualization (ggplot2).\nviridis: This package provides color palettes that are more accessible for people with various forms of color blindness.\nedbuildr: This package was developed by EdBuild to provide more accessible school finance data. It allows you to download data from the National Center for Educaiton Statistics (NCES) and the U.S. Census Bureau that has been cleaned using EdBuild’s methodology for handling such data.\nremotes: This package allows you to download packages hosted on GitHub, such as edbuildr.\n\nTo install these packages, open RStudio. In the “Console” pane, paste this code and then run it by hitting return:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\", \"viridis\", \"remotes\")\n\nremotes::install_github(\"edbuild/edbuildr\")"
